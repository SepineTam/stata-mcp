# Stata Do File Executor

## Overview

StataDo is the core module in MCP-for-Stata responsible for executing Stata do files. It provides a secure and reliable way to run Stata scripts with automatic result logging, supporting three major operating systems: macOS, Linux, and Windows.

## Key Features

### Cross-Platform Support

StataDo automatically adapts to different operating systems:

- **Unix-like Systems (macOS/Linux)**: Interacts with Stata through standard input stream for efficient command execution
- **Windows Systems**: Uses batch file method to execute Stata commands, ensuring compatibility

### Automatic Logging

Every time a do file is executed, StataDo automatically:

1. Creates a new log file or creates a log at the specified path
2. Records the complete Stata execution process and output results
3. Saves log files in the `stata-mcp-log` directory for easy review and analysis

### Optional Execution Timeout

Set `timeout` to a positive number of seconds to stop a long-running Stata process.
The default value is `None`, so execution time is unlimited unless the caller opts in.

### Security Guarantees

StataDo includes built-in security check mechanisms:

- **Command Filtering**: Blocks shell-escape commands that may compromise system security (such as `!cmd` or `shell cmd`)
- **Content Validation**: Checks do file content before execution to prevent malicious command execution

### Exact-Source Audit Snapshot

For MCP calls, StataDo stores the exact do-file bytes under
`.statamcp/snapshot/objects/<full-sha256>.do` before Stata starts. Stata executes
that immutable snapshot rather than the mutable source path. The tool ledger,
snapshot metadata, SHA-256, and generated log paths share one Audit `run_id`.

See [Audit Trail](../../audit.md) and
[Snapshots and Security Linkage](../../audit/snapshots-security.md).

### Smart Terminal Emulation

StataDo simulates a standard terminal environment to ensure consistent and readable Stata output:

- Sets fixed terminal dimensions (120 columns × 40 lines)
- Ensures cross-platform output consistency

## Workflow

1. **Preparation Phase**: Accepts do file path and log file path parameters
2. **Security Check**: Validates do file content to ensure no dangerous commands
3. **Snapshot Creation**: Stores and verifies the exact source bytes that will be executed
4. **Environment Adaptation**: Selects appropriate execution method based on operating system type
5. **Script Execution**: Calls Stata CLI to execute the immutable snapshot
6. **Result Logging**: Writes execution process and results to log file
7. **Audit Finalization**: Links terminal status, snapshot, security decisions, and logs to the run
8. **Cleanup**: Removes temporary files (Windows platform)

## Use Cases

StataDo is primarily used in the following scenarios:

- **Batch Data Processing**: Executes do files containing data cleaning, transformation, and other operations
- **Statistical Analysis**: Runs regression analysis, descriptive statistics, and other Stata commands
- **Chart Generation**: Executes Stata scripts that generate statistical charts
- **Automated Research Workflows**: Calls Stata for data analysis in AI Agents or automated scripts

## Integration with Other Modules

StataDo is an important part of the MCP-for-Stata toolchain:

- **StataFinder**: Provides the path to the Stata executable
- **StataController**: Provides higher-level Stata control interfaces
- **Logging System**: Automatically records execution results in the specified log directory

## File Path Conventions

StataDo follows the MCP-for-Stata directory structure conventions:

- **Do File Directory**: `~/Documents/.statamcp/stata-mcp-dofile/`
- **Log File Directory**: `~/Documents/.statamcp/stata-mcp-log/`

## Important Notes

1. **File Encoding**: StataDo reads do files using UTF-8 encoding; ensure your do files are saved with UTF-8 encoding
2. **Path Handling**: On Windows systems, spaces in paths are automatically handled
3. **Log Overwriting**: By default, existing log files will be overwritten; this behavior can be controlled via parameters
4. **Error Handling**: Exceptions are thrown when execution fails; callers should properly handle these exceptions
5. **Execution Timeout**: Execution is unlimited by default; pass a positive `timeout` value to enforce a limit
6. **Evidence Handling**: Treat `.statamcp/audit/` and `.statamcp/snapshot/` as potentially sensitive, append-only project evidence
