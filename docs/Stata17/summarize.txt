Syntax

        summarize [varlist] [if] [in] [weight] [, options]

    options           Description
    ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
    Main
      detail          display additional statistics
      meanonly        suppress the display; calculate only the mean; programmer's option
      format          use variable's display format
      separator(#)    draw separator line after every # variables; default is separator(5)
      display_options control spacing, line width, and base and empty cells

    ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
    varlist may contain factor variables; see fvvarlist.
    varlist may contain time-series operators; see tsvarlist.
    by, collect, rolling, and statsby are allowed; see prefix.

    aweights, fweights, and iweights are allowed.  However, iweights may not be used with the detail option; see weight.

Description

    summarize calculates and displays a variety of univariate summary statistics.  If no varlist is specified, summary statistics are calculated for all the
    variables in the dataset.

    detail produces additional statistics, including skewness, kurtosis, the four smallest and four largest values, and various percentiles.

    meanonly, which is allowed only when detail is not specified, suppresses the display of results and calculation of the variance.  Ado-file writers will
        find this useful for fast calls.

    format requests that the summary statistics be displayed using the display formats associated with the variables rather than the default g display
        format; see [D] format.

    separator(#) specifies how often to insert separation lines into the output.  The default is separator(5), meaning that a line is drawn after every five
        variables.  separator(10) would draw a line after every 10 variables.  separator(0) suppresses the separation line.

    display_options:  vsquish, noemptycells, baselevels, allbaselevels, nofvlabel, fvwrap(#), and fvwrapon(style); see [R] Estimation options.
