Description

    save stores the dataset currently in memory on disk under the name filename.  If filename is not specified, the name under which the data were last known
    to Stata (c(filename)) is used.  If filename is specified without an extension, .dta is used.  If your filename contains embedded spaces, remember to
    enclose it in double quotes.

    Stata 14 through 17 have the same dataset format so long as the dataset has 32,767 variables or less.  Since Stata/MP 15, Stata/MP has supported more
    than 32,767 variables and thus has a slightly different dataset format when there are that many variables.  If you are using Stata 17 and want to save a
    dataset so that it may be read by someone using Stata 16 or Stata 15, simply use the save command; those older versions will be able to read it.  If the
    dataset has more than 32,767 variables, it can be read by Stata/MP 16 and Stata/MP 15.  If you want to save a dataset so that it may be read by someone
    using Stata 14, again simply use the save command; Stata 14 will be able to read it so long as it does not have more than 32,767 variables.  Stata 14
    supports at most 32,767 variables.

    saveold saves the dataset currently in memory on disk under the name filename in previous .dta formats, namely, those for Stata 13, 12, or 11.  If you
    are using Stata 17 and want to save a file so that it may be read by someone using an older version of Stata, use the saveold command.

Options for save

    nolabel omits value labels from the saved dataset.  The associations between variables and value-label names, however, are saved along with the dataset
        label and the variable labels.

    replace permits save to overwrite an existing dataset.

    all is for use by programmers.  If specified, e(sample) will be saved with the dataset.  You could run a regression; save mydata, all; drop _all; use
        mydata; and predict yhat if e(sample).

    orphans saves all value labels, including those not attached to any variable.

    emptyok is a programmer's option.  It specifies that the dataset be saved, even if it contains zero observations and zero variables.  If emptyok is not
        specified and the dataset is empty, save responds with the message "no variables defined".


Options for saveold

    version(#) specifies which previous .dta file format is to be used.  # may be 16, 15, 14, 13, 12, or 11.  The default is version(13), meaning Stata 13
        format.  To save datasets in the modern, Stata 17 format, use the save command, not saveold.  Stata 14 through Stata 17 share the same format, so you
        do not have to use saveold to save a Stata 14, 15, or 16 dataset; simply use save.

    nolabel omits value labels from the saved dataset.  The associations between variables and value-label names, however, are saved along with the dataset
        label and the variable labels.

    replace permits saveold to overwrite an existing dataset.

    all is for use by programmers.  If specified, e(sample) will be saved with the dataset.  You could run a regression; save mydata, all; drop _all; use
        mydata; and predict yhat if e(sample).


Examples

    Setup
        . input number odd even

               number        odd       even
          1. 1 1 2
          2. 2 3 4
          3. 3 5 6
          4. 4 7 8
          5. end

    Save data in memory to file
        . save myevenodd

    Add another observation
        . input

               number        odd       even
          5. 5 9 10
          6. end

    Resave myevenodd after additional observation has been added
        . save myevenodd, replace

    Equivalent to above command
        . save, replace

    Save data under name myevenodd2 in Stata 13 format
        . saveold myevenodd2

    Save data under name myevenodd3 in Stata 12 format
        . saveold myevenodd3, version(12)
